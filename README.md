# _Anagrams_

#### _Fun with Anagrams, 9-17-2017_

#### By _**Dan Nollette**_

## Description

_This application uses a custom class to check whether or not two string inputs are anagrams, palindrome, antigrams or none of the above. The application has a runner file which can be used to try out the functionality of the application's custom method from the terminal._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

#### Requirements
* _A computer with access to a terminal application_

_Open your terminal and go to the directory where you would like to install the application. run:
`git clone https://github.com/Dan-Nollette/anagrams` folloed by `ruby runner.rb` _

## Known Bugs

_There are no known bugs at this time. Note that while the application uses a custom class it doesn't initialize a custom object. The project objectives didn't specify that you needed to initialize an object, so I opted to use class methods instead._

## Technologies Used

_This application uses Ruby._
